# Reliable control of complex systems

With the rapid advancement of robotics and artificial intelligence, robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate at high speeds and near the limits of stability. However, the ability to control such systems safely and reliably under **uncertainty and model mismatch** has not kept pace with their growing complexity and autonomy, particularly for inherently unstable tasks.

Entering my Ph.D., I aim to develop and implement **learning-enabled nonlinear control frameworks** for fast, safety-critical robotic systems. My current research focuses on integrating data-driven models and online optimization within nonlinear MPC to improve performance while preserving stability and safety guarantees.

My current work at [CARA LAB](https://cara-lab-rice.github.io/) focuses on automated vehicle control beyond stability limits, with results coming soon!

# Undergraduate research

My undergraduate research has focused on the **design of mechatronic systems and the rapid prototyping** of robotic and medical devices, with an emphasis on translating engineering concepts into functional, experimentally validated hardware. Through these projects, I have worked at the intersection of mechanical design, modeling, and applied engineering for biomedical and robotic applications.

Representative projects include:

1) [Minimally invasive healing of bone implant-cement interfaces by aerogel cement and remote heating](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100680)

2) [Predicting biaxial failure strengths of aortic tissues using a dispersed fiber failure model](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eml.2024.102287)

3) Senior Design - [An Implantable Finger Prosthetic](https://kaijiasresearch.godaddysites.com/finger-prosthetic)
