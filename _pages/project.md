My research interests center on the reliable control of complex robotic and autonomous systems operating under uncertainty and near stability limits. I focus on developing principled control frameworks that integrate nonlinear control theory with data-driven methods to ensure safety, 
robustness, and predictable performance. In particular, my work studies learning-augmented control strategies that enable vehicles to maintain or recover from unstable operating regimes, such as drifting, with the broader goal of providing formal stability and safety guarantees for real-world robotic systems.

# Reliable control of complex systems

With the rapid advancement of robotics and artificial intelligence, robots are now capable of performing tasks that were previously unimaginable. 
As robotic systems increasingly permeate everyday life, the question of how to control them safely and reliably has not always kept pace with their growing complexity and autonomy. 
Entering my Ph.D. studies, I aim to bridge this gap by developing principled control frameworks for fast, complex robotic systems that integrate machine learning to handle uncertainty while preserving formal safety and stability guarantees.

I am currently working on automated vehicle control beyond stability limits, with results coming soon!
