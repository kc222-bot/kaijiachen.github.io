My name is Kaijia Chen, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu)
 advised by [Sasha Davydov](https://davydovalexander.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of **Robotics, Control, and Machine Learning**, with a current focus on data-driven control methods for the reliable operation of complex physical systems. In particular, I study how nonlinear control theory and machine learning can be combined to enable vehicles to maintain stability and recover from unstable operating regimes, such as drifting. My broader goal is to develop and experimentally validate control frameworks that allow robotic systems to operate safely and predictably in the presence of uncertainty, especially as learning-based methods become increasingly integrated into real-world systems.

In Spring 2025, I completed my Bachelor’s degree at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu), where I majored in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, I researched with Dr. Xiaoguang Dong at the [Miniature Robotics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/donglab) and Dr. David Braun at the [Advanced Robotics & Control Lab](https://davidbraunrobotics.com). I also interned twice at Coloplast Corp. as an R&D Engineer, working on the design and development of medical devices.
